<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Mapping algebra provides operational semantics to the mapping process, opening
the door to study of complexity and expressiveness of existing mapping languages.
This project provides the CLI translator from RML to mapping algebra.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Prerequisites

To compile the project on your own, you'll need to have
[Rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed.

For Linux-based users:

- Rust
  ```sh
  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
  ```

For the visualization of the generated mapping plans, you'll need
python version >= 3.10 and the following packages:

1. graphviz

## Running

1. Download this repo
2. Run cargo build at the root this repo
   ```sh
   cd {repo dir}
   cargo build --release
   ```
3. Run the CLI translator app from the compiled translator binary
   ```sh
   cd ./target/release/
   ./translator  file  <RML_DOCUMENT>
   ```
   For more information/options of CLI app:
   ```sh
   ./translator  -h
   ```
4. Visualize the created mapping plan
   ```sh
   dot -Tpng {generated dot file} > output.png
   ```
5. Simple plain text format of the mapping plan for parsing
   ```sh
   dot -Tplain {generated dot file} > output.txt
   ```

## Test cases

Currently, the translator will generate valid mapping plans for the official
[RML test cases](https://github.com/kg-construct/rml-test-casesk) with mapping plans
for CSV data sources (all test cases ending in **CSV**).

The generated mapping plans for the test cases are inside the
[/resources/csv-testcases](/resources/csv-testcases).

## Acknowledgement

This software makes use of [sophia_rs](https://github.com/pchampin/sophia_rs) crate!
