<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Mapping algebra provides operational semantics to the mapping process, opening
the door to study of complexity and expressiveness of existing mapping languages.
This project provides the CLI translator from RML to mapping algebra.

## Example use cases

To check the sort of input and the corresponding output of mapping algebra translation from RML to algebraic operators, the files are located under `resources` folder.
<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Prerequisites

To compile the project on your own, you'll need to have
[Rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed.

For Linux-based users:

- Rust
  ```sh
  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
  ```

For the visualization of the generated mapping plans, you'll need 
python version >= 3.10 and the following packages: 

1. graphviz



## Running

1. Download this repo
2. Run cargo build at the root this repo
   ```sh
   cd {repo dir}
   cargo build --release
   ```
3. Run the CLI translator app
   1. From Cargo 
       ```sh
       cargo run --bin translator -- {args}
       ```
   2. From the compiled translator binary
       ```sh
       cd ./target/release/
       ./translator {args}
       ```
      
4. Visualize the created mapping plan 
   ```sh
   ./visualizer.py {args}
   ```
